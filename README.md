# YoutubeDl-Commander
This a repo containing the (currenly GUI only code) for the program Youtube-DL Commander. This tool is meant to give a GUI system for creating commands in the Youtube-DL program.

Currenlty, this project only contains the code for the GUI and I am not sure if I am going to scrap this and redesign from scratch or continue with this project.
